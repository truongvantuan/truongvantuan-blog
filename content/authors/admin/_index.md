## About Me

Hello, I'm Tuan from Ha Tinh, a Java Web Developer with 5 years of experience specializing in Spring Boot backend development. My journey began with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, which gives me a unique perspective and a strong foundation for working on projects related to factories and manufacturing systems.

I am passionate about Linux and frequently write guides on installing, configuring, and optimizing Linux operating systems, as well as programming tools for this platform. You can explore my Linux tutorials for practical tips and solutions.

In addition to development, I actively translate technology articles about Java, deepening my expertise and sharing knowledge with the community. My translated articles are available in the "Bai viet" section.

The source code for this website is open on GitHub, with comprehensive usage documentation provided. Thank you for visiting my site—if you have any questions, feel free to reach out via email or through the social networks listed above.
